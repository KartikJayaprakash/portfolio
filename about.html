          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Zoom Photography was born from a love affair with the art of capturing life's most intimate and fleeting moments. Founded by [Founder], our journey began with a simple belief â€“ that every instant, every emotion, and every connection deserved to be celebrated in its purest form.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p>We believe that photography is more than just freezing time; it's about encapsulating the emotions, stories, and magic that make each moment unique. Our lenses aren't mere tools; they're instruments of storytelling that bridge the gap between the present and the memories that will be cherished for generations.</p>
